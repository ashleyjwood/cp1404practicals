# CP1404 Practicals

## About

This repository is a collection of the work I have completed for the weekly practicals assigned as part of the CP1404
subject.

## Lessons I have learnt about "clean code"

- **"Explicit is better than implicit" - The Zen of Python:** It's important to write clear and straightforward code
  rather than trying to be too clever.
- **Start with general, easy-to-read functions:** Writing general functions that are easy to read is often better than
  writing situation-specific code.
- **Learn common practices:** Familiarising yourself with common coding practices is extremely useful for efficient code
  evaluation, interpretation, and reviews.
