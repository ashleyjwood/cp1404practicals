# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
Mostly inaccurate, however I expected this as I struggle with keeping track of time if I don't set timers.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
It did get slightly better as I went, although I suspect that this was more luck than anything else.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
Nothing that I can think of.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
I don't believe I received any useful code reviews.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
There are many possible ways to get similar outcomes, even within the structure of the subject.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 7](https://github.com/HanyuXiao05/CP1404/pull/3#event-13668257338)


### Explanation
Review notes were short, to the point, and provided examples when needed.

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 9](https://github.com/YuanRuiGao/cp1404practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-2217577726)

### Explanation
The review utilised the functionality of marking specific text as `code`. It was also very thorough, once again 
providing examples when I felt as though they were necessary, however, looking back, I feel as though I could have put
more effort into "leading the horse to water instead of forcing it to drink" as such.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
Personally, I would have made fewer of the tasks mandatory, as there were many that took a long time, especially 
towards the end. I do understand, however, that this would lead to students potentially having a less robust 
understanding of the learning outcomes.    

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I put effort in. I completed every task, every week.
