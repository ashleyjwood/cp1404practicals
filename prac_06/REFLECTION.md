Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have tried to read the entire exercise before beginning. (So far, not successful.)

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Read the entire exercise before beginning.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Trying.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Poorly worded. 
If you're asking what I have stopped doing already:
I have stopped assuming I know exactly what you're looking for in the exercise because I often interpret it incorrectly.

If you're asking what I need to stop doing:
I need to stop not taking longer breaks, as I frequently lose track of time, partly due to my ADHD.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

N/A
