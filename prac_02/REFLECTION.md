# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Time: Whenever I can. Usually at the start of the week or on the weekend before. This way if I have any questions or things that really don't make sense, I can bring these issues to both PASS and the tutorial.
Location: Uni as often as possible, home other than that.
Duration: If I'm feeling good, I back-to-back every subsection of the lesson, taking time to do the examples. If I'm feeling not so good, I just for as long as I can.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Keeping up-to-date with lectures and assessment.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Stop hyperfocussing / getting distracted with things that are out of scope for the current item. 

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

It's hard to say. There has only been one practical and it was fairly simple, so I don't really have any opinion yet.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Same as previous answer.
